

The values in the respective CSV files represent:

link ID (for disrupted link), time in seconds (for time at which disruption commences), link capacity (i.e., flow in units of vehicles per hour), link flow speed, number of lanes

The file contains information for two rows (one for each direction of traffic). 

Disruptions are assumed to be indefinite, so a second row is NOT included for each link in order to indicate a restoration of full capacity

Scenarios a and c have the same disruption input values (i.e., full disruption of the link after the specified time) 

Scenario b has disruption input values that approximate a partial (i.e., 50%) disruption after the specified time

Scenarios a and b have the same Plans input values

Scenario c has Plans input values that approximate half of the passenerger trips not occuring (i.e., being indefinitely postponed) after the disruption
